# javascript-challenge
In this assignment, I designed a JavaScript code that extracts an array of objects and adds them to an HTML table.

The results can be filtered depending on the input that the user enters.

It uses D3 to define inputs, as well as call on a filter function upon clicking a button.

UFO sightings that match all of the criteria (which can be left as blank) will display in on the screen, while those that do not match the criteria will be filtered out.

I have designed this code so that the table may restore the filtered rows if the user removes the filter and clicks Filter Table again.

UFO-level-2 is the bonus task, in which I expanded the filtering fields to include more than just the date of the sighting. In this case, the filtering criteria uses multiple conditions.
